List of recipes in order to practice HTML

This project is a recipe file, that has a main page listing all the recipes, and then at least 3 recipes listed.  
Each recipe should have an image, description, ingredients, and steps.

Notes on Learning:
Practicing the HTML is important - a great way to type out all the boilerplate.
I understand why commit messages are important to notate logs.  I'm trying to think about "if applied, this change will ..." when writing my subjects, but also using the Conventional Commits Guidelines.
